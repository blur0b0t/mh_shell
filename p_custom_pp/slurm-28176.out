Loading the tokenizer from the `special_tokens_map.json` and the `added_tokens.json` will be removed in `transformers 5`,  it is kept for forward compatibility, but it is recommended to update your `tokenizer_config.json` by uploading it again. You will see the new `added_tokens_decoder` attribute that will store the relevant information.
You are resizing the embedding layer without providing a `pad_to_multiple_of` parameter. This means that the new embedding dimension will be 32104. This might induce some performance reduction as *Tensor Cores* will not be available. For more details about this, or help on choosing the correct value for resizing, refer to this guide: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#requirements-tc
