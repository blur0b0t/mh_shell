1900,1901,"One of the most powerful tools in a developer's arsenal is JavaScript. It's a versatile language used for both client-side and server-side scripting. A fundamental concept in JavaScript is the function. Here's a basic example of a function in JavaScript:
function sayHello() {
console.log('Hello, world!');
}
This function, when called, will print 'Hello, world!' to the console. Understanding functions is key to mastering JavaScript.",,

This is a basic example, but it gives you an idea of what a Java program looks like.",True,"public class HelloWorld {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\nSystem.out.println('Hello, World!');\n}\n}"
1903,1904,"Software development, an integral part of any tech company, serves as the backbone for most digital services. Web applications, desktop software, mobile apps, all these are brought to life by skilled developers. For instance, in Java, a popular language, you might initialize a list of Strings as List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();. This simple line helps you store multiple names in a single variable.

Software development is a wide field with several specializations. There's front-end development focused on user interface, back-end development for server-side logic, and full-stack that covers both. Specialized roles like data science and machine learning also exist, requiring knowledge of specific libraries and packages.",True,List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();

Known for its simplicity and readability, Python has found its place in various fields including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. It's the preferred language for beginners due to its straightforward syntax.

Python's wide usage can also be attributed to the vast selection of libraries it offers. From NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, to TensorFlow and Keras for machine learning, the choices are immense.",False,
1905,1906,"Web development is a popular field in software development. It involves creating websites or web applications. Front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are often used to design the interface. For instance, a simple JavaScript function could be function greet() { alert('Hello, world!'); }. This function, when called, would display a pop-up greeting.

Back-end technologies usually include a server, an application, and a database. Languages like Python, Java, and Ruby are commonly used, with frameworks like Django, Spring, and Rails respectively.",,
1906,1907,"C++ is a general-purpose programming language that gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. Useful for many software contexts, but especially for system software, game development, and real-time systems.
